Just tell me what's happened.

00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:57,082
And what is it?

7
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,270
I'll be right down.

What's happened?

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,934
Er, Susannah.

10
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,551
Susannah?

11
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:14,121
Princess Susannah.

12
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:15,926

What are you doing? Keep it going.

36
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,863
Prime Minister, at this point,
I think it's important to say

37
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:16,419
that we are 100% certain

38
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,659
that this is, indeed,

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,027
Princess Susannah.

40
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:23,411
Her car was intercepted
shortly after midnight,

41
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,350
returning from the wedding
of a college friend.

42
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:28,400
She'd insisted on going.

43
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,301
But you had security on her?

44
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,379
Two PPOs, still unconscious.

45
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:35,715
Heavy sedative, close range,
each with a single puncture wound.

46
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,465
No sign of struggle.

47
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:41,372
What do they want? Money?

48
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,114

Save the fucking libraries?

51
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,731
We are convinced both the video and
the demand it contains are genuine.

52
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:57,856
What demand?

53
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:00,153
What Susannah says next...

54
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:04,684
It concerns you directly, sir.

55
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,434

specifications for the broadcast.

68
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:10,718
Why are you doing this?

69
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,036

72
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:25,926
She said pig.

73
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:28,324
Sex with a pig.

74
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:33,473
They want me to have sex with a pig?

But what... ? Who... ?

78
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:50,309
We're checking with embedded
operatives, compiling a list of suspects.

79
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,903
Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

80
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,793
There's not long to
formulate our response.

81
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:58,113
Well, I'm not fucking a pig!

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,621
Page one, that's not happening.

83
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:04,121
Of course.

84
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,301
Absolutely, sir.

85
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,668
Well, have we established
a dialogue with this... ?

86
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,981
We can't. There's no e-mail
address, no code word.

87
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,780
No channel for negotiation.

88
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,779
So we focus on finding
Susannah. We get her back.

89
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,926
However it's done, I don't
care. We stop this now.

90
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,223
Everyone's working towards this.

91
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:37,197
Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated
core team. This can't go wide.

92
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:40,949
Keep it so far from the press
it's on the other side of Jupiter.

93
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,442

What?

99
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,659
It was uploaded via an
encrypted IP an hour ago.

100
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,940
Well, get it off there!

101
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:12,298
We did after nine minutes, long enough
for it to be duplicated and spread.

102
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,287
Spread? How many people have seen this?

103
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,819
We take down one, six
clones pop up elsewhere.

104
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,147
How many people?

105
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:23,318
50,000. That's our current estimate.

106
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:27,342
The news rooms have got it.

107
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,120
They're running this on air?

108
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,927
No. We put a type five D notice
out and they're complying.

109
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,318
For now.

110
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,180

111
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,569
Oh! For... fucking internet!

112
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,455
So what now? What's the play book?

113
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,150
This is virgin
territory, Prime Minister.

114
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,666
There's no play book.

115
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,459
Princess Susannah's been kidnapped!

116
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,921

117
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:05,486

How do we describe
it? "An indecent act"?

127
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,499
Everyone's seen the video.
They know the details.

128
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,056

Ofcom would be pissed off.

129
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:37,029
Fuck Ofcom!

130
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,379
We're observing the D Notice.

131
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,690
Surely we're going to do something.

132
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:40,816
We are honouring the D Notice.

133
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,128
The voluntary D Notice!

134
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,944
It may be a sportsman-like
gesture but we are making it.

135
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:47,729
A woman's life is at stake!

136
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:48,980
We follow the procedure.

137
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,814
My timeline consists

139
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:55,415
You don't.

140
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:56,892
That is totally backwards.

141
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,438
No-one else has broken rank.

142
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:00,094

00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,117
Facebook's coverage is
pretty comprehensive!

144
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,688
Maybe

145
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,071
It's like 9/11's happening and

It's on CNN and Fox.

149

150
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,569

00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:39,059
Ken, the internet aspect, new paradigm,
Twitter, Arab spring, all that.

The Obit VT?

161
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,702
Mm-hm. First, an awkward phone
call. Least I can do is warn Tom.

162
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,218
We put a D Notice on it.

163
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,340

164
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,619
Don't. I'm begging you.

165
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,619
Don't run it, Martin.

166
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,059
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I can't help you.</i>

167
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,498
You know how much help

170
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,677

171
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:16,739

174
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,660
Tom, so you're across it...

175
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,946
I'm exploring contingency plans.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,304
<i>I briefed Callett.</i>

177
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,220
Ah! Mr Callett. Noel, from Blue Eye.

You won't find better.

181
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,499
Can you map a head onto a body live?

182
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,740
Depends if your camera's moving.

183
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:50,109
Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held
camera in a constant roving motion.

184
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,453
Mm.

185
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:54,562
Yeah, Gonzo style. He knows
his shit. That's tough.

186
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,890
"Fruition to be transmitted in full"?

187
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:02,300
Focus on the visuals. Different
face mapped onto a live performer.

188
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,201
According to those stipulations.

189
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:05,966
Fringes of possibility...

190
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:09,076
Deadline's at four. We need to
know if it's workable by two.

191
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,271
(LAUGHS)

192
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,780
Can't happen.

193
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:16,699
It has to.

194
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,619
Our embeds have ruled out the
major players. It's not AQ, not IRA.

195
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,396
This is what's left...
radicals, hate groups.

196
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,859
People who've threatened
yourself or the royals.

197
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,339
They're being pulled in as we speak.

198
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,912
For more than questioning, I hope.

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,975
Somebody know something.

200
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,820
SIREN BLARES

201
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:41,821
<i>If we all do it more, there'll
be less waste lying around...</i>

202
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,750
Is it still not on the telly?

203
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,739
Nothing. Must be a hoax.

204
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,179
Or a black-out. Oh! Heads up!

205
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,539
<i>Some major breaking news here on UKN.</i>

206
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:54,126
In the last two minutes

207
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:57,508
<i>It's been confirmed that
Susannah, Duchess of Beaumont</i>

208
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,923
<i>has been kidnapped.</i>

209
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:02,016
<i>A video uploaded
anonymously to the Internet</i>

210
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,554
<i>appears to depict the
princess pleading for her life.</i>

211
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,522
<i>The video also contains a bizarre
ransom demand of a personal nature</i>

212
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:14,499
<i>involving the Prime Minister,
and a detailed list of instructions</i>

213
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,859
<i>relating to the
enactment of this demand.</i>

214
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,686
<i>As police round up potential suspects...</i>

215
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,163
<i>... across the nation.</i>

216
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,259
<i>... This viewer video shows officers
raiding an address in Bradford.</i>

217
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,100
<i>A man thought to be
connected with a religious</i>

218
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:31,939
<i>pressure group,
dragged to a waiting van...</i>

219
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,619
If it's terrorists,
they'll take her head off.

220
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,259
For fuck's sake, man! Just saying.

221
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,779
They'll be asking for a
million quid or something.

222
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,378
They want him to do it with a pig.

223
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,519
Demands...

224
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:49,292
Telegraph has the whole video and an
interactive timeline. Tonally stark.

225
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:52,737
Brief mention of the ransom being
"a sex act". Nothing too gross.

226
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:56,261
Sun runs with "Taken".
Big grab of Susannah...

227
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,820
Of course I still want that drink.

228
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,464
Then give me something.

229
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,808
It's not...

230
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,748
That won't be possible.

231
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:06,128
I'm friendly when I drink.
Very friendly when I'm grateful.

232
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,004
There's no comment at this time

233
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,862
The Guardian are running
a fucking live blog

234
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:27,219
and a short piece on the
historical symbolism of the pig.

235
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,299
PHONE BEEPS

236
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,339

<i>I couldn't bear to watch that.</i>

245
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,020
<i>I won't be tuning in. Just
thinking about it is horrible.</i>

246
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,792
<i>That's disgusting. It is disgusting.</i>

247
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,539
<i>It is disgusting but...
after that, he's gonna be hero.</i>

248
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,131
<i>People will look at him like he's
insane and take his position away.</i>

249
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:14,202
<i>It will be hilarious to see that on TV.</i>

250
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,619
<i>Nothing too abnormal for MPs.</i>

251
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,180
<i>They're all sexual deviants,
all MPs and Prime Ministers.</i>

252
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,620
We've been squeezing
hard, but nothing concrete.

253
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,877
It's my house! You can't...

254
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:34,182
You are in my doorway
touching my door handle!

255
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,060
Could I have a word?

256
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,218
It won't come to that.

257
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:45,380
And if they don't find her?

258
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,579
MI5 have got a name.

259
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,738
They're surrounding the place now.

260
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:49,775
Where?

261
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:50,783
What?

262
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:52,127
Where's the place?

263
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,283
Truro.

264
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:54,791
- Why are you lying?
- What?

265
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,065
You're lying!

266
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,099
Truro? Jesus!

267
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,470
I don't want you worrying.

268
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,376
You've never patronised
me. Don't start now.

269
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,298
Whoever this is, is insane.

270
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,778
And has a princess.

271
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,838
We'll get through this.

272
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,353
Not any princess... the princess.

273
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,219
Princess bloody Facebook bloody
eco-conscious national sweetheart.

274
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,460
I won't have to do anything.

275
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:19,011
Everyone's laughing at us.

276
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,094
You don't know that.

277
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,711
I know people.

278
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:23,414
We love humiliation.

279
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,634
I can not laugh

280
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,930
Nothing is going to happen.

281
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,914
It's already happening in their heads.

282
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,700
In their heads, that's what you're
doing, what my husband is doing.

283
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,383
Please!

284
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,586
Jane.

285
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,321
I love you.

286
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:48,647
KNOCK ON DOOR

287
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:49,983
What?

288
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,820
Palace on the phone, sir.

289
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,859
Get Alex to stall them.

290
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,899
She's already been speaking
to her for ten minutes.

291
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,701
"Her"?

292
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,188
It's the Queen herself.

293
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,164
Go on.

294
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,766
<i>As the 4pm deadline draws
nearer, the world holds its breath...</i>

295
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,352
waiting to discover where the princess

296
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,071
Would they use a female pig?

297
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:21,813
It's on the list.

298
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,781
List of rules, specifies
camera angles and things.

299
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:26,243
Like dogme 95.

300
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,644
It's not like Dogme 95.

301
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,746
Exactly that.

302
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:30,139
What's Dogme 95?

303
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
Cinematic movement.

304
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,802
Lars von Trier.

305
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,068
Oh...

306
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,690
Rules for a director...
no background music,

307
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,289
only natural light, for authenticity.

308
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,339
Same as these, so they can't cheat,
cut another guy's arse pumping away.

309
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,367
<i>I can't think of
anything remotely like this.</i>

310
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,890
<i>A new form of terrorism...</i>

311
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:54,399
It's not Islamist. To request
a pig is specifically abhorrent.

312
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:57,032
<i>That's the point! Make love to a pig!</i>

313
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:58,673
Make love?

314
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,499
Steer them away from the grisly details.

315
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,459
<i>Let's not dwell on any of the details.</i>

316
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,899
<i>This is already a huge
national talking point.</i>

317
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,299
<i>Isn't this precisely what whoever
is behind this is looking for?</i>

318
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,339
How's Her Majesty taking it?

319
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,563
"I trust you'll do everything
in your power to get her back."

320
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:21,139
And we are.

321
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,259
It wasn't a collective "you".
It was a singular "you", ie me.

322
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,099
Sir, we may have something. Jamie's
been tracing the video's origin.

323
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,415
I thought it was untraceable.

324
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,262
Technically, yes, so I thought,
"Work with what we do now"

325
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:37,181
That video, before Youtube
compression it was 57.3 meg.

326
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,388
Algorithm.

327
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:43,861
Anyway, we also know it
was uploaded at 3:16 AM.

328
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,033
I ran a nationwide traceback
on uninterrupted one-way uploads

329
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:51,306
of precisely 57.3 meg in the
minutes leading up to 3:16,

330
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,026
and the closest I can get is a postcode.

331
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,979
It came from somewhere in there.

332
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,135
Looks like a campus.

333
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,099
Yeah. Closed 2010.

334
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,779
It's been empty since.

335
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,859
Latest I-sat image on this area?

336
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,140
3 AM flyover shot from last night...

337
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,869
Looks like it had lights on.

338
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:16,510
We got him. We got him.

339
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,713
Alert the local team.
Full squad. I'll man it.

340
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:23,065
With helmet-cam relay. We
can watch the operation.

341
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:24,932
Press office, OK, Tom?

342
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,854
Yes!

343
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,179
Right. Confident?

344
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,339
It's a kick-bollock scramble, but
with finessing it should be OK.

345
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,660
Finesse quickly. Our
performer's on his way.

346
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:53,225
CAR STOPS

347
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,219
It's a new one for me, obviously.
I wouldn't normally... You know.

348
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,219
You seen any of my films?

349
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,114
No.

350
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,106
I'm pretty trad... bish,
bash, bosh. In, out.

351
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,763
Yeah, well...

352
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,099
What do I put on the invoice?

533
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,580
putting personal embarrassment
over the life of a girl.

534
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,819
They will not release her anyway.
She's probably already dead.

535
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,736
If she isn't, he'll kill
her and upload the video.

536
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:04,699
Everyone will see it.
The world will see it.

537
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,019
The mood will border on insurrection
and you will be destroyed,

538
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,140
I guarantee you... utterly destroyed.

539
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,745
The polling bears that out.

540
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,979
You won't just be a
disgraced politician,

541
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,099
The public, the Palace and
the Party insist on compliance.

542
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:30,359
Fuck the Party!

543
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:33,146
Refuse, and I've been advised

544
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,779

your physical safety.

545
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,422

546
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,009

00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,883

549
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:01,047

It's out of your hands.

it'll be a criminal of fence to store
any recording or images of the event.

560
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,562
They're doing an announcement
to warn people off

561
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:19,464

567
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,059

displayed incredible bravery

568
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,820

569
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,049
That's how it opens,
then we should move on...

570
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,660
OK. Yeah.
